Bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated EIDs.",open,cc-by,2016-3-31,10.1038/ismej.2015.138,"[{'name': 'Plazi', 'type': 'DataCurator'}]","[{'identifier': 'biosyslit'}, {'identifier': 'coviho'}, {'identifier': 'globalbioticinteractions'}]",eng,"['Phylogeny', 'Virus Diseases', 'corona viruses', 'virus-host', 'Viruses', 'biotic associations', 'China', 'Humans', 'pathogen-host', 'Chiroptera', 'CETAF-taskforce', 'biotic interaction', 'Emerging', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Biodiversity', 'Coronaviridae', 'Public Health', 'covid', 'covid-19', 'pathogens', 'Viridae', 'biotic relations', 'Animals']","{'obo:RO_0002453': [{'subject': ['Chaerephon plicata', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtCp-BetaCoV/YN2011']}, {'subject': ['Hipposideros pratti', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtHp-BetaCoV/ZJ2013']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/AH2011']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/FJ2012']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/GD2012-a']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/GD2012-b']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/GD2012']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/HeN2013-a']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/HeN2013']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/HuB2013-a']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/HuB2013']}, {'subject': ['Miniopterus fuliginosus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMf-AlphaCoV/JX2012']}, {'subject': ['Myotis daubentonii', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMd-BetaCoV/HuB2013']}, {'subject': ['Myotis ricketti', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMr-AlphaCoV/SAX2011']}, {'subject': ['Myotis spp.', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtMs-AlphaCoV/GS2013']}, {'subject': ['Nyctalus velutinus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtNv-AlphaCoV/SC2013']}, {'subject': ['Pipistrellus abramus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtPa-BetaCoV/GD2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-AlphaCoV/HuB2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-AlphaCoV/YN2012']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-BetaCoV/HeB2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-BetaCoV/HeN2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-BetaCoV/HuB2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-BetaCoV/JL2012']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRf-BetaCoV/SX2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus pusillus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRp-BetaCoV/SAX2011']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus sinicus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRs-BetaCoV/GX2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus sinicus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRs-BetaCoV/HuB2013']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus sinicus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2013']}, {'subject': ['Tylonycteris pachypus', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtTp-BetaCoV/GX2012']}, {'subject': ['Vespertilio superans', 'bat'], 'object': ['BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013']}, {'subject': ['bat'], 'object': ['East respiratory syndrome CoV', 'MERS-CoV']}, {'subject': ['bat'], 'object': ['Severe acute respiratory syndrome', 'SARS-CoV']}]}",The ISME journal,10,3,609--620,,

Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98\% sequence identity in 9.8\% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs.

Here we present a phylogeny of 18 bat species, each of which is represented in 1,107 orthologous gene alignments used to build the tree. We generated a transcriptome sequence of Hypsignathus monstrosus, the African hammer-headed bat, and additional transcriptome sequence for Rousettus aegyptiacus, the Egyptian fruit bat. We then combined these data with existing genomic and transcriptomic data from 16 other bat species. In the analysis of such datasets, there is no clear consensus on the most reliable computational methods for the curation of quality multiple sequence alignments since these public datasets represent multiple investigators and methods, including different source materials (chromosomal DNA or expressed RNA). Here we lay out a systematic analysis of parameters and produce an advanced pipeline for curating orthologous gene alignments from combined transcriptomic and genomic data, including a software package: the Mismatching Isoform eXon Remover (MIXR). Using this method, we created alignments of 11,677 bat genes, 1,107 of which contain orthologs from all 18 species. Using the orthologous gene alignments created, we assessed bat phylogeny and also performed a holistic analysis of positive selection acting in bat genomes.

PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65\% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81\% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy.

Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines.

This finding provides new genetic evidence for Chinese horseshoe bats as the source of human SARS-CoV.",open,cc-by,2016-2-29,10.1093/infdis/jiv476,"[{'name': 'Plazi', 'type': 'DataCurator'}]","[{'identifier': 'biosyslit'}, {'identifier': 'coviho'}, {'identifier': 'globalbioticinteractions'}]",eng,"['ORF8', 'Evolution', 'Sequence Analysis', 'bats', 'corona viruses', 'Genotype', 'virus-host', 'Molecular', 'SARS Virus', 'biotic associations', 'China', 'Humans', 'Sequence Homology', 'pathogen-host', 'Chiroptera', 'CETAF-taskforce', 'biotic interaction', 'DNA', 'Viral', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Coronaviridae', 'Cluster Analysis', 'covid', 'covid-19', 'RNA', 'pathogens', 'Viridae', 'origin', 'Viral Matrix Proteins', 'biotic relations', 'Animals']","{'obo:RO_0002453': [{'subject': ['Chaerephon plicata', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Chaerephon', 'bat'], 'object': ['SARS-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus affinis', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus macrotis', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus pusillus', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus sinicus', 'Chinese horseshoe bats'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus sinicus', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus', 'bat'], 'object': ['SARS-CoVs']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–like CoVs', 'SL-CoVs']}]}",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,213,4,579--583,,

Cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats, which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential. Therefore, understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species. Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.",open,cc-by,2015-01-01,10.1111/ele.12491,"[{'name': 'Plazi', 'type': 'DataCurator'}]","[{'identifier': 'biosyslit'}, {'identifier': 'coviho'}, {'identifier': 'globalbioticinteractions'}]",eng,"['covid', 'virus-host', 'ecological networks', 'covid-19', 'biotic associations', 'pathogen-host', 'CETAF-taskforce', 'Chiroptera', 'pathogens', 'emerging infectious disease', 'zoonoses', 'Coronaviridae', 'Viridae', 'biotic interaction', 'Rodentia', 'corona viruses', 'biotic relations']","{'obo:RO_0002453': [{'subject': ['Rhinolophus ferrumequinum', 'bat'], 'object': ['SARS-like coronavirus']}]}",Ecology Letters,18,11,1153--1162,,
publication,article,"Recombination, Reservoirs, and the Modular Spike: Mechanisms of Coronavirus Cross-Species Transmission","[{'name': 'Graham, Rachel L.'}, {'name': 'Baric, Ralph S.'}]","Over the past 30 years, several cross-species transmission events, as well as changes in virus tropism, have mediated significant animal and human diseases. Most notable is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a lower respiratory tract disease of humans that was first reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. The disease, which quickly spread worldwide over a period of 4 months spanning late 2002 and early 2003, infected over 8,000 individuals and killed nearly 800 before it was successfully contained by aggressive public health intervention strategies. A coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS, and initial assessments determined that the virus crossed to human hosts from zoonotic reservoirs, including bats, Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), sold in exotic animal markets in Guangdong Province. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern coronavirus cross-species transmission both in vitro and in vivo, using the emergence of SARS-CoV as a model. We pay particular attention to how changes in the Spike attachment protein, both within and outside of the receptor binding domain, mediate the emergence of coronaviruses in new host populations.",open,cc-by,2010-4-30,10.1128/JVI.01394-09,"[{'name': 'Plazi', 'type': 'DataCurator'}]","[{'identifier': 'biosyslit'}, {'identifier': 'coviho'}, {'identifier': 'globalbioticinteractions'}]",eng,"['covid', 'virus-host', 'covid-19', 'biotic associations', 'pathogen-host', 'CETAF-taskforce', 'pathogens', 'Viridae', 'Coronaviridae', 'biotic interaction', 'corona viruses', 'biotic relations']","{'obo:RO_0002453': [{'subject': ['Nyctereutes procyonoides', 'raccoon dogs'], 'object': ['SARS-CoV']}, {'subject': ['Paguma larvata', 'himalayan palm civets'], 'object': ['SARS-CoV']}, {'subject': ['Rhinolophus', 'bat'], 'object': ['severe acute respiratory syndrome', 'SARS']}, {'subject': ['bovine'], 'object': ['bovine coronavirus', 'BCoV']}, {'subject': ['canine'], 'object': ['canine coronavirus', 'CCoV']}, {'subject': ['feline'], 'object': ['feline coronavirus', 'FCoV']}, {'subject': ['murine'], 'object': ['Murine coronavirus', 'MHV']}, {'subject': ['porcine'], 'object': ['porcine coronavirus', 'PCoV']}]}",Journal of Virology,84,7,3134--3146,,
